#### Interactive Mode

This is the interactive python environment. You can enter python commands directly into this and they will run as python. This is a great tool for quickly testing python commands.

2. Try that now using an example. Type or copy the following into the python interactive environment after the **>>>**
```
some_string = "Hello Python"
print(some_string)
```
* Press **Enter**. You will see the result.

{{% notice info %}} 
We have just created your first python variable called **some_string** and given it a value **"Hello Python"**.\
We then printed the value of the variable using the built in **print** function.
