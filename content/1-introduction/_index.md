#### Introduction

This workshop will teach you the basics of the python programming language using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

It is aimed at beginners who have never programmed in python and it uses similar methods of explaining the basics as other books and tutorials on the python programming language.

It differs in that all the examples aim to get you started building on AWS rather than learning how to build a game, website, manipulate or visualize data.
